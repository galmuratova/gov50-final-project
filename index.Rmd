## Initial Project Ideas

There are a couple of topics I wish to explore with this upcoming project. The following list entails some ideas...

1. Correlation between the usage of online dating apps and domestic violence cases reported. 
2. Correlation between the availability of thrift stores and the number of colleges within counties across the US
3. Literacy rates (or levels of education) and voting patterns in the US

Overall, I'm still open to different topics. After looking through the availability of data sets, I think I can narrow down my ideas.
